# Abstract Task / Queue / Worker vs Actual Job / Job type / Robot
# How to match these :
# - Task is code, and should not be changed when installing.
# - Worker is configuration and can be changed when installing.
# - Queue is dependent on application and environment and should be changed when installing.
#
# * robot <=> worker, ie : 1 and only one worker per robot ( no point to run concurrent tasks on robot )
# * job type <=> task, ie : 1 and only one task per job type (and one job type per task)
#   -> this is how we will configure the job type ( for now at least )
# * Queue <-> Robot ?  We know when sending which robot will get it
#   -> predictible behavior from beat -> scheduler can make final decision with all information.
# * Queue <-> Job Type ? We can dynamically reassign robot from one job type to another...
